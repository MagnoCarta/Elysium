Here you have nothing to fear, nothing to risk, nothing to expose, it's the perfect bubble, nothing happens!\nYou don't look way too comfortable or safe, am I wrong? Few are the ones who deserve the void. I'm here to warn you, you can still deserve it, but one thing is for sure: after you start, there is no turning back!\nSomething bigger is bound to happen soon and your actions will influence what will happen, how do you feel after knowing all this?\n"
